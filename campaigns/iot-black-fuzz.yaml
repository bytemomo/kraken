    ======

    This campaign is used to automatically find fuzzable services in the network and then
    fuzz them with fine tuned modules for the said protocols, for now the supported protocols
    are:
        - MQTT
        - RTSP

    The campaign can require a lot of time to execute and also could find anything usefull.
    Each module handles alone the connection, fuzzing process and results savings. This mean
    that depending on the module the results could be saved with different formats.

    If possible, as you will see specified in the params of each module, it would be nice to
    give the modules access to the process that they are fuzzing.

    This is beacause a white box approach (code path analysis, and output analysis) could give
    more informations than a black box approach (that uses only a network response based approach).

    As this campaign concetrate in finding implementation bugs in the servers that uses this protocol
    it does not have an attack trees file.

    NOTE: NEVER use this campaign in a production environment as it will try to find unknown
    vulnerabilites in the protocols servers, this could lead to crashes and a downtime in the
    production environment. Even if the campaign does find any vulnerability the trafic generated
    could creates many allerts and flood the network making it more unstable.
